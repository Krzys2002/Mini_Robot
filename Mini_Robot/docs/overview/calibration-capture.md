# Intrinsic calibration target capture

Issue #53 implements observation capture. Issue #54 adds the
[intrinsics solver and quality reporting](intrinsic-calibration.md).
Calibration-profile persistence (#55) and tabletop homography (#57) remain separate.
No AprilTag identity or WorldModel updates occur during this workflow.

## Target and operator workflow

Use the [printable chessboard](../calibration/chessboard-9x6-25mm.svg):

- **9 columns × 6 rows of inner corners**, formed by 10 × 7 squares.
- Square side: **0.025 m (25 mm)**. Black/white board extent: 250 × 175 mm.
- White border: 15 mm on each side. Total printed extent: 280 × 205 mm.
- Print in landscape at 100% without fit-to-page. Measure square dimensions in
  both directions and mount on a flat, rigid surface. Do not use a stretched,
  curved or glossy target. The chosen workflow is chessboard, not ChArUco.

Select and start a camera in the main window, then click **Camera calibration…**.
The dialog previews the current camera. Click **Start / restart capture** and
**Capture view** while holding the entire board still and in focus. Detection
runs asynchronously. Each usable, distinct view is accepted automatically.

Green dots show accepted inner corners. Red dots show rejected detections when
corners are available. The yellow ring identifies the first corner. Visually
check alignment with the printed intersections. Use the accepted-view selector
to inspect any stored view. **Live view** returns to the current camera image;
**Capture view** always uses the latest camera frame, even during review.

Move the board around the image, change its distance, rotate it in the image,
and tilt it out of plane. Keep its full outer border visible. The progress text
shows view count, occupied image regions, scale spread and rotation spread.
The capture policy is a heuristic for useful diversity, not proof of a
well-conditioned calibration. Tilt and reprojection quality must also be
assessed visually and through solver reprojection errors.

**Remove / recapture selected** deletes that view and returns to live preview;
then capture its replacement. **Start / restart capture** clears all observations.
**Cancel / close** or Escape discards an unfinished session. **Calculate intrinsics**
completes capture and solves the in-memory dataset on a worker. Closing a completed
dialog preserves it until restart, camera loss/change or application exit.
There is no disk export; see the intrinsic-calibration guide for result handling.

## Quality gates and diversity

`CalibrationCaptureConfig` centralizes the injectable thresholds. Defaults:

| Gate | Default |
| --- | --- |
| Full grid | Exactly 54 finite, row-major inner corners |
| Edge clearance | All inner corners at least 4 pixels from image boundaries |
| Minimum board size | Inner-corner quadrilateral covers at least 2% of image area |
| Sharpness | Grayscale Laplacian variance in target bounding rectangle ≥ 40 |
| Redundancy | RMS corner displacement / image diagonal ≥ 0.025 against every accepted view |
| Completion | At least 10 views, 3 distinct centre cells in a 3 × 3 grid, scale spread ≥ 0.08, rotation spread ≥ 0.20 rad |
| Storage | At most 24 accepted views and 128 MiB of retained frame storage |
| Input size | At most 4 megapixels, neither dimension above 4096 |
| Input freshness | Latest frame no more than 2 s old at capture request |

Redundancy comparison also considers reversed corner order, accounting for the
unmarked chessboard's 180° ambiguity. Scale is the square root of inner-board
area / image area. Rotation is the first row's heading, compared modulo pi.
Repeated sequence numbers and captures no newer than an accepted frame are
rejected. Invalid layouts, incomplete boards, mixed resolutions, insufficient
sharpness, clipped inner corners and memory/view limits yield visible feedback.
A full outer-border check is an operator responsibility: inner-corner bounds do
not by themselves prove the outer squares and border are wholly visible.

The fixed target in this version uses row-major metric object points with the
first inner corner at (0, 0, 0), x along columns, y along rows and z = 0.
These coordinates describe the target plane, not the future tabletop world frame.

## Architecture and lifecycle

- `micro_robot_calibration`: Qt/OpenCV-free target geometry, quality/diversity
  policy, bounded observations and explicit Idle/Collecting/Complete/Cancelled
  state. `ICalibrationDetector` is the image-processing boundary.
- `micro_robot_calibration_opencv`: portable OpenCV detector using
  `findChessboardCornersSB`. OpenCV 4 uses calib3d; OpenCV 5 moved detection to
  objdetect. Frame pixels are read-only and Gray8/RGB/RGBA padded rows are supported.
- `CalibrationController`: GUI-thread application adapter with an injected
  detector and a single detection worker. A capture snapshots the newest frame.
  No further jobs queue while it is busy. Frames/corners are plain domain values.
- `CalibrationWizard`: Qt presentation, corner overlays, review and action routing.
  It contains no detection or acceptance algorithm.

DesktopController forwards immutable frames and source/stream availability without
changing camera ownership or bypassing `ICameraSource`. Stop requests, source
changes and disconnect/fault events clear the session. Resolution changes clear
it on the next frame. Generation tokens discard any result already in flight.
Restart/cancel can invalidate a job without blocking the GUI. Shutdown asks the
worker to quit, and the main event loop drains both capture and detector workers
before destruction. Normal destruction therefore does not wait on detection.

## Build and verification

Desktop builds include the detector automatically. To run detector tests without
Qt, configure with `-DMICRO_ROBOT_BUILD_DESKTOP=OFF
-DMICRO_ROBOT_BUILD_CALIBRATION=ON`. To omit OpenCV entirely, disable desktop,
replay and calibration. The pure capture library/tests remain available.

```sh
cmake --build build/issue-53 --parallel 3
ctest --test-dir build/issue-53 -R '^Calibration' --output-on-failure --no-tests=error
ctest --test-dir build/issue-53 --output-on-failure --no-tests=error
```

Deterministic tests generate chessboards in memory, including rotated, scaled,
perspective-transformed, padded/color, blurred, partial and blank images. Session
tests cover quality rejection, duplicates, diversity, limits and transitions.
Offscreen UI tests exercise capture/review/completion, remove/recapture,
restart/cancel, stale input, source and resolution changes, worker execution,
bounded jobs and discarding cancelled results.

### Manual acceptance procedure

1. Print and measure the target, select a physical camera and open the wizard.
2. Capture a diverse set without external scripts. Inspect every overlay.
3. Try blur, partial/clipped board, small board and repeated view. Confirm feedback.
4. Review earlier views, remove one, recapture it, then finish after all diversity gates pass.
5. Test cancel/restart, camera stop/removal/source change, and shutdown during detection.
6. Repeat UI checks on Linux X11/Wayland and later Windows as available.

Physical camera/printed-target acceptance, Linux GUI behavior and Windows have
not been verified by the automated tests. Physical acceptance is tracked separately
in [#179](https://github.com/Krzys2002/Mini_Robot/issues/179). Record actual physical
outcomes there; do not infer them from passing deterministic tests.

## Verification record (2026-10-19)

On macOS with Apple Clang 21, Qt 6 and OpenCV 5.0.0:

- Desktop Debug configure/build: passed, including the production application.
- `ctest --test-dir build/issue-53 --output-on-failure --no-tests=error`:
  **187/187 passed**, including 20 new calibration tests and platform-boundary checks.
- Qt/OpenCV-free configure/build with desktop, replay and standalone calibration
  disabled: passed. `ctest --test-dir build/issue-53-core --output-on-failure
  --no-tests=error`: **123/123 passed**.
- Standalone detector configure/build with desktop/replay disabled and calibration
  enabled: passed. `ctest --test-dir build/issue-53-headless -R '^Calibration'
  --output-on-failure --no-tests=error`: **12/12 passed**, without Qt.
- The offscreen wizard was rendered and inspected for controls, review selector,
  progress feedback and accepted-corner overlay. The UI regression test also
  verifies that accepted green corner markers reach the rendered preview.
- A detector-to-session test completes the default ten-view capture policy from
  varied generated board images. This is deterministic evidence, not a physical
  camera/printed-board acceptance result.

Physical target/camera capture, Linux X11/Wayland GUI checks, Windows runtime,
and an OpenCV 4 build were not run. The source/CMake compatibility branch for
OpenCV 4 remains for Linux CI to validate. Intrinsics, distortion and reprojection
error calculation remain #54; profile persistence remains #55.
